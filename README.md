# MBTA Bus Network Redesign Scripts & Files

## Network Quality Metrics

### [Measure Development](Measure-Development/) – Anna, Alissa, Monisha?
- [x] Literature reviews on competitiveness, access measures – included links to competitiveness literature review and literature review as a part of our published paper
- [x] Development of our current approach to network quality and the required components (competitiveness, trip coverage, regional access), including trips vs. residences and how we think about equity in this process – included link to folder with published paper. Details have changed a lot since publishing time, but the high level why and the approaches to equity and the measures in general are still relevant
- [ ] BAZ development and other foundational supporting work

### Travel Demand
- [ ] Iterations of 2018 LBS data to Streetlight and comparison between them – Anna, Alissa, Julianna?
- [ ] Process of the Streetlight runs, including parameters and time periods – Alissa or Karl?
- [ ] Demographic corrections and post-processing to combine modes – Karl 

### Competitiveness
#### Competitiveness Formula – Monisha 

- [ ] Development of the competitiveness concept as we use it today (travel time as the comparison value, factors being considered, the fact that it’s the foundation of other measures rather than a standalone measure)
- [ ] Development of the current competitiveness formula, including original assumptions and changes from summer 2021 engagement
- [ ] Future things, including potential for a seniors/people with disabilities-specific formula (to hand off to Connor)

#### Technical Execution – Joaquin, Karl
- [ ] Drive times, including paths not taken and the current process using Streetlight
- [ ] Transit routing, including the iterations of routing software and the current process in Conveyal
- [ ] How the current process actually runs, including Conveyal inputs/parameters and all of the post-processing that produces itineraries with calculated competitiveness

#### Trip Coverage – Monisha 
- [ ] Philosophical: purpose, development, what it tells us and what it doesn’t, equity
- [ ] Technical: inputs, methodology, scripts, outputs

### Regional and Local Access – Julianna

#### Regional Access
- [ ] Regional destinations 
- [ ] Philosophy, development, changes from summer 2021 engagement
- [ ] Methodology, scripts, inputs, outputs
- [ ] Philosophical: purpose, development, what it tells us and what it doesn’t, equity
- [ ] Technical: inputs, methodology, scripts, outputs

#### Local Access
- [ ] Local destinations 
- [ ] Philosophy, development, changes from summer 2021 engagement
- [ ] Methodology, scripts, inputs, outputs
- [ ] Philosophical: purpose, development, what it tells us and what it doesn’t, equity
- [ ] Technical: inputs, methodology, scripts, outputs

## Bus Network Redesign

### Misc. Process
- [ ] Expansion of OPMI’s role in the project beyond network quality metrics – Alissa has a document outlining this that could serve as a documentation foundation
- [ ] High-priority corridors analysis (1st and 2nd iterations) – final process documented by CS, could use a little more context/backstory on how we eventually got there – Anna, Alissa?
- [ ] Summer 2021 survey engagement – will probably be mostly documented in Alissa’s OPMI-role document (Julianna and Monisha’s roles) and results documented with specific measures

### Network Evaluation Process
- [ ] Remix development, including all 1,000 issues – Karl, Monisha, decisions document, others?
- [ ] GTFS development and QA – Karl, others?
- [ ] Crosswalks and other supporting work – Karl, others?
- [ ] Additional metrics, including RVM, frequency, simplicity, coverage – Anna, Alissa, Julianna
- [ ] Supplemental analyses, including frequent routes coverage, transfers analysis, other things for SWA – Alissa, Tim
- [ ] Development of public engagement materials, including one-pagers and website content – Alissa, others (Connor, Sam)?
